# Algo-Project

This project aims at making a TIME TABLE GENERATOR using M-Colouring problem of graph based on  backtracking. In any educational institution, the two most common academic scheduling problems are course timetabling and exam timetabling. A schedule is desirable which combines resources like teachers, subjects, students, classrooms in a way to avoid conflicts satisfying various essential and preferential constraints. Graph coloring is an algorithm that can deal timetable scheduling satisfying changing requirements, evolving subject demands and their combinations. This project aims at properly coloring the course conflict graph and transforming this coloring into conflict-free timeslots of courses. Course Conflict graph is constructed with courses as nodes and edges drawn between conflicting courses.
